# 1. Java Formatting

## Naming Conventions
- **Class** names and **file** names should be in PascalCase. 
   - ex: the `HelloWorld` class in the file `HelloWorld.java`
   - NOT the `Helloworld` / `helloworld` / `helloWorld` class
- **Method** and **variable** names should be in camelCase. 
  - ex: the method `getUser()`, NOT `GetUser()` or `getuser()`
  - ex: the variable `maxHealth`, NOT `MaxHealth` or `max_health`
- **Constants** should be written in all uppercase and words should be separated by underscores
  - ex: `MAX_LIFT_HEIGHT`, NOT `maxLiftHeight`

## Statements
- if-else statements
  - `else` and `else if`'s should be put on the same line as the ending `}` for the previous control statement
  ```java
  if (condition) {
      // code here ...
  } else if (condition) {
      // code here ...
  } else {
      // code here ...
  }
  ```
  
## White Space
- Blank lines should be put between methods, but not variables (unless the variables are being grouped somehow).
  - ex:
  ```java
  // vegetables
  int tomatoes = 0;
  int lettuce = 1;
    
  // meat
  int chicken = 2;
  int beef = 3;
    
  public void eat() {
      System.out.println("yum");
  }
        
  public void sleep() {
      System.out.println("zzz");
  }
  ```

- There should be a space between a class/method/etc. name and its `{`.
- There should NOT be a space between a method name and its `(`.
  - ex:
  ```java
  public int add(int x, int y) {
      return x + y;
  }
  
  add(1, 2);
  ```
  
## Indentation
- A `{` is put at the end of a line and the statements after it (but before its `}`) should be indented. 
- A `}` is put at the beginning of a line with the same indentation as the line with its corresponding `{`.
  - ex:
  ```java
  public static boolean isPrime(int x) {
      for (int i = 2; i < x; i++) {
          if (x % i == 0) {
              return false;
          }
      }
      return true;
  }
  ```
